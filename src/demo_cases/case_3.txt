Mr. David Thompson, a 38-year-old male, reported acute lower back pain radiating down his left leg following a lifting injury at work. He described sharp, shooting pain exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest, without urinary or bowel dysfunction. Diagnosis of acute lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to disc herniation, was made, initiating conservative management with rest, oral steroids, and physical therapy referral.
